                    The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with.
                    It may be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply held
                    prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately want to
                    be true. But our preferences do not determine what's true. We have a
                    method, and that method helps us to reach not absolute truth, only
                    asymptotic approaches to the truth — never there, just closer
                    and closer, always finding vast new oceans of undiscovered
                    possibilities. Cleverly designed experiments are the key.
